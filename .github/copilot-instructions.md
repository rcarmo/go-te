# Copilot instructions (skeleton)

This is a starter template for repositories created inside Agentbox.

## Mandatory: use the Makefile

Use `make` targets for build/lint/test/format/dev flows whenever available.
If you need a new workflow step, add a Make target rather than running ad-hoc commands.

## Common workflows (expected Make targets)

- `make help` -- list targets
- `make install` / `make install-dev` -- install dependencies
- `make lint` / `make format` -- static checks / formatting
- `make test` -- run tests
- `make coverage` -- run tests with coverage (if available)
- `make check` -- run the project's standard validation pipeline
- `make clean` -- remove local build/test artifacts

## CI/CD convention

CI should call `make check` (or `make lint` + `make test` when `check` doesn't exist).
Keep CI logic minimal; prefer Make targets for consistency.

## Environment and Package Management

If `AGENTBOX_ENVIRONMENT` is set, then:

- You have `uv` and `brew` to install whatever tooling you require (as well as `sudo apt`)
- You should install Python packages with `--user --break-system-packages` rather than use a `venv` to minimize workspace size
- You _may_ have `docker` installed (but disabled - check first before using it)
- If it is set to `gui`, then you have a running X server at :10
